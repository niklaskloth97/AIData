        "Process Overview": "In the SAP Order-to-Cash (OTC) process, each step corresponds to specific database tables that store relevant data. Here's a mapping of the OTC process steps to their respective SAP tables:\n\n1. **Create Sales Order (SO):**\n- **Tables Involved:**\n  - **VBAK:** Stores sales order header data, including sales document number (VBELN) and order type.\n  - **VBAP:** Contains sales order item details, such as material numbers and quantities.\n- **Process Details:**\n  - When a sales order is created using transaction VA01, data is recorded in the VBAK and VBAP tables.\n\n2. **Approve Sales Order (SO):**\n- **Tables Involved:**\n  - **VBAK:** Includes approval status and relevant workflow details for sales orders.\n- **Process Details:**\n  - Approval statuses are updated in the VBAK table as the order moves through the approval process.\n\n3. **Delivery Creation:**\n- **Tables Involved:**\n  - **LIKP:** Stores delivery document header data, including delivery number (VBELN) and shipping details.\n  - **LIPS:** Contains delivery item details, such as material numbers and quantities.\n- **Process Details:**\n  - Deliveries are created using transaction VL01N, populating the LIKP (header) and LIPS (item) tables.\n\n4. **Goods Issue (GI):**\n- **Tables Involved:**\n  - **MKPF:** Stores material document header data for goods movements.\n  - **MSEG:** Contains material document item details, including references to delivery documents.\n- **Process Details:**\n  - When goods are issued for a delivery, the system records the movement in MKPF (header) and MSEG (item) tables.\n\n5. **Billing Document Creation:**\n- **Tables Involved:**\n  - **VBRK:** Holds billing document header data, such as billing document number (VBELN) and invoice date.\n  - **VBRP:** Contains billing document item details, including material numbers and amounts.\n- **Process Details:**\n  - Billing documents are created using transaction VF01, populating VBRK (header) and VBRP (item) tables.\n\n6. **Receive Payment:**\n- **Tables Involved:**\n  - **BKPF:** Stores accounting document header data, including document number (BELNR) and fiscal year (GJAHR).\n  - **BSEG:** Contains accounting document item details, such as customer accounts and payment amounts.\n- **Process Details:**\n  - When a payment is received, the system records accounting entries in BKPF (header) and BSEG (item) tables.\n\nUnderstanding the relationships between these tables is crucial for effective data management and reporting in the SAP OTC process.\n\nFor instance, linking sales orders to deliveries involves joining VBAK and LIKP tables using the sales document number (VBELN).\n\nSimilarly, connecting deliveries to billing documents requires joining LIKP and VBRK tables via the delivery number (VBELN).\n\nThese table linkages facilitate seamless tracking and management of order fulfillment activities within SAP.",
